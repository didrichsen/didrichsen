- 👋 Hi, I’m @didrichsen
- 👀 I’m curious, intersted in many things and always willing to learn. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for a bachelor's degree in programming. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for whatever interests me, but a summer intern would have been awesome and is high on my wishlist.
- 📫 You can reach me @ simendidrichsen@gmail.com.
